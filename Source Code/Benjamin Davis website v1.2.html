		<p> Hi, and welcome to my website. This is a page that I have created in
			 HTML, through lessons learned from
		 <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"> Freecodecamp</a>
		  where I learned everything I needed to start and code my own page! I then
			reinforced my learning through the website and the app called
			 <a href="https://www.sololearn.com" target="_blank"> SoloLearn.</a>

		 <!-- white space line breaks for readability.													 -->
		  <br> <br>

		 This website is an example, of the skills that I have aquired in the courses I have taken. The art is from various other sites, for placeholders only. These are to practice sizeing, scale and composition with color for the purpose of learning. This is it so far as of: 7-20-2018. v1.2 - Benjamin Davis
